To use, just include "clickTouch.js" in your web application
and run "clickTouch.init()" when the document is ready.

You can also run "clickTouch.init(true)" to prevent default
override mouse events entirely.

Example (if using jQuery):
$(document).ready(function(){
	clickTouch.init();
});
